# Phoenix - Discord BOT

This is my first real-life programming project, a **Discord BOT** written in **python**.
I have used [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## What I've learned by building this project

- Python syntax
- What are and how to work with APIs
- How is like building real projects

## Conclusion

- Being my first project, the codebase is old and written poorly, this project was me just playing around with the language and the API.
- I am no longer updating this project.
